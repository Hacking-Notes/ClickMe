### What is multistep clickjacking
Multi-step clickjacking extends the deceptive principles of basic clickjacking into a more sophisticated and dangerous attack chain. While traditional clickjacking aims to trick users into performing a single unintended action, multi-step variants orchestrate coordinated interactions across multiple pages or states.
